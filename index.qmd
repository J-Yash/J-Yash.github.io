I'm a Research Software Engineer - Machine Learning at [Cyberinfrastructure for Network Science Center](https://cns.iu.edu), Indiana University Bloomington with a focus on computer vision in the context of spatial bioinformatics. I work on segmentation, annotation, analysis, and visualization methods using histology and spatial proteomic datasets for single cell, functional tissue units, and anatomical structures in human samples.
